# CDIL-blocks Wordpress Theme

A [block-based theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/block-themes/) developed by Tim Lindgren for the [Center for Digital Innovation in Learning - Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/academics/sites/cdil.html) at Boston College. 

Originally based on [Extendable - WordPress theme | WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/themes/extendable/) but not much is left from the original theme

Under heavy development and for internal use only at this point - not really ready for sharing.
